/**
 * Payload documents → component props.
 *
 * Takes two sources: the global owns the section's label and heading, the
 * `services` collection owns the entries. They were one document until projects
 * needed to tag themselves with the entries.
 *
 * The shapes diverge in three places, which is why this exists rather than
 * spreading the documents straight in:
 *   - `image` comes back as a Media object (or a bare id at depth 0)
 *   - the link is two flat fields, not a nested object
 *   - `headingLines` is an array of rows, not an array of strings
